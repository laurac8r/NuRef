Below is a description of each file and folder in Backup.

NuRef1 is the code incorporating the ability to read a gdml files. it already implemented the use of GPS. NuRef1-Build is where it it was built. One can either run the built one or build another one.

NuRef2 is the code that incoporate computing energy deposited nad dose using vector container as well as what NuRef1 does. NuRef2-Build is where it it was build. One can either run the built one or build another one.

hfng.gdml is the gdml file that we are currently working with.

run.mac is the macro file with the correct positioning and anular and enery distribution for running NuReF at 100 KeV deuterium beam energy.

test.gdml is for use in adding functionality to NuReF. It enables easy testing of the functionality as it only loads about three parts of the geometry.

test.mac is used to test run. it provides isotropic source at 2.45 MeV correctly positioned
